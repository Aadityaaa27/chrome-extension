Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to build a Chrome Extension that monitors user activity across different tabs and websites, records time spent on each site, and presents the data through interactive and visually appealing dashboards. It is especially useful for professionals, students, and freelancers who wish to optimize their online time usage.
Key Features:

    Time Tracking:
        Automatically tracks time spent on various websites.
        Logs active tabs and records duration of activity.
        Pauses tracking when the user is inactive for a specified period.

    Website Categorization:
        Allows users to categorize websites (e.g., Work, Entertainment, Social Media, Learning, etc.).
        Provides default categories with options to create custom ones.
        Tracks category-wise productivity and visualizes data.

    Productivity Analysis:
        Generates daily, weekly, and monthly reports.
        Displays statistics through graphs and charts (e.g., bar charts, pie charts).
        Compares productivity levels over time and suggests improvements.

    Goal Setting & Notifications:
        Allows users to set daily or weekly productivity goals.
        Provides real-time alerts when exceeding time limits on non-productive sites.
        Encourages productivity streaks and achievements.

    User-Friendly Interface:
        Simple and intuitive UI integrated within the Chrome toolbar.
        Easy-to-understand dashboards powered by libraries like Chart.js .
       

    Data Privacy:
        Stores data locally on the userâ€™s device.
        Provides the option to backup data to cloud services if needed.

    Customizable Settings:
        Users can exclude specific websites from tracking.
        Option to manually add or edit time entries.
        Dark and light themes for better accessibility.

Technical Stack:

    Frontend:
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React can be used for building dynamic interfaces).
        TailwindCSS or Bootstrap for styling.

    Backend (Optional):
        Can be built using Node.js, Express for storing user data if cloud storage is desired.

    APIs & Libraries:
        Chrome Extension APIs (e.g., chrome.tabs, chrome.storage, chrome.runtime).
        

How It Works:

    The extension runs as a background script that listens to browser events such as tab updates, switching, and idle status.
    Time spent on each active tab is recorded and associated with a specific category.
    Data is processed and displayed via the popup interface when the user clicks on the extension icon.
    Reports and analytics are generated based on collected data, providing insights and recommendations.

Future Enhancements:

    Adding AI-driven insights to suggest productivity improvements.
    Implementing syncing across multiple devices.
    Creating a habit-building system to encourage productive patterns.
    Integrating with popular productivity tools like Trello, Notion, and Todoist.

This project will provide users with a powerful tool to track their online activities, analyze their productivity trends, and make data-driven decisions to enhance their efficiency
